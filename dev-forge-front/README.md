# Actionable Gamified Development Application

This application called Dev Forge is something I designed to help teach myself to be a better full-stack developer and progress to a more senior-level full-stack developer through a series of gamified learning paths, projects, challenges, and feedback mechanisms. The front-end is built using React and related technologies, while the back-end is built with Java Spring MVC.

## Features

- **Learning Path**: Structured modules and paths to guide learning.
- **Projects**: Real-world projects to apply and test skills.
- **Challenges**: Coding challenges to reinforce learning.
- **Feedback**: Mechanism to provide and receive feedback.
- **Profile**: User profile to track progress and achievements.
- **Search**: Search functionality to find specific modules, projects, or challenges.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
- **CSS Modules**: Modular and reusable CSS styles.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.

### Back-End

- **Java Spring MVC**: A framework for building web applications and RESTful services in Java.
